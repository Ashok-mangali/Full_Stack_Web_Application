- Full Stack Web Application

  I am developing a Fullstack web application using React.js for the frontend, Python with Flask for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
  The application includes Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. React.js handles the frontend, Flask manages the backend, and MongoDB is responsible for the database.
  The application covers all aspects of web development, making it a complete Full Stack Web Application.
